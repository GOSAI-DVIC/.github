## What is GOSAI ❓

GOSAI is a software operating system designed to simplify the development of augmented reality experiences powered by a computer. The project was born in December 2021 in De Vinci Innovation Center.
Get to know more about the project : [🔗👉 here (project link) 👈🔗](https://dvic.devinci.fr/projects/gosai)!

## Structure of a GOSAI platform program

A platform running using GOSAI is the combinaison of :
- The 'gosai' repository which is the common **core** program 🧠
- A 'platform' repository which is the **front-end** program that comes to be attached within the 'gosai' repository, under a folder name called 'home' 📺
